This is the repository for the survey paper: A Survey of Link Prediction in N-ary Knowledge Graphs. Recent efforts have increasingly focused on link prediction in NKGs.

Despite the rapid development of link prediction methods for NKGs, with nearly 50 methods proposed, existing surveys only briefly mention it, lacking a comprehensive and in-depth analysis. More statistics of existing surveys are related to traditional KGs, including general KG, temporal KG, etc. Therefore, we completed this survey of link prediction in NKGs.

## üöÄ Preliminary

### üåü Definition
**KG**: A traditional structure consisting of binary facts (triples) of the form , linking a head entity to a tail entity via a relation.

**NKG**: A generalized structure that supports n-ary facts, each involving more than two entities, allowing richer semantic representation.

**Link Prediction in NKGs**: The task of inferring missing entities or roles in existing n-ary facts.

### üîç Formalizations of N-ary Facts
**Hyperedge formalization**: Represents facts as fixed-size, ordered tuples.

**Role-value pair formalization**: Represents facts as unordered sets of role-entity mappings.

**Hyper-relational formalization**: Represents facts as a primary triple with additional qualifiers.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Recap of Methods

We investigate **three** types of link prediction methods in NKGs: Spatial Mapping-based Methods, Tensor Decomposition-based Methods, and Neural Network-based Methods.

- **Spatial Mapping-based Methods:** These methods map entities into a shared embedding space, enforcing geometric constraints to ensure meaningful spatial relationships among them. They can be further divided into three types based on the embedding space: Euclidean, hyperbolic, and complex space-based methods.
- **Tensor Decomposition-based Methods:** Such methods represent the set of facts in an NKG as a high-order tensor, where each tensor entry indicates the truth value of a particular fact. By reconstructing, decomposing, and optimizing this tensor, the model uncovers latent pattern features among the elements of n-ary facts, thereby enhancing link prediction accuracy.
- **Neural Network-based Methods:** These methods leverage neural networks to encode NKGs and perform link prediction with learned element representations. They can be categorized into four types: FCN-based, CNNbased, Transformer-based, and GNN-based methods. Each type employs a corresponding neural network architecture to encode n-ary facts.
